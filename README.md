# SpellingCop
SpellingCop is a bot for Telegram that corrects your spelling of certain words. 
Instead of running messages through a language's dictionary, this bot enforces a custom set of rules that can be set.

Imagine your friends spell your name wrong all the time. How annoying! SpellingCop to the rescue!
